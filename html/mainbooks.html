					<h1>Welcome to Check out the Books</h1>
					<p>Check out the Books is an organization that exists to shine a light on the dark and hidden workings of our public libraries' financial system.  We believe that robust oversight and full disclosure are necessary to prevent the embezzlement and fraud that have been rampant in the system since the loosening of financial safeguards in the Reagan administration.</p>
					<p>Our algorithm allows you to look at the impact that government budget cuts and surpluses (as well as increases or decreases in patronage) are likely to have on your local library system.  It allows you to choose a city and a range of years, as well as giving you the flexibility to input different minimums and maximums for both public and private patronage.</p>
